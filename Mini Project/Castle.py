    Now let's determine your character's skills, which you will use throughout the game.
    In this game, your character has four skills:
    
    - Strength, which you will use in combat or any strength test
    - Dexterity, which you will use in any ability test
    - Magic, which you will use whenever you need to cast a spell or use/inspect a magical item or place
    - Life, which determines your life energy, points will be lost when hurt, 
      and whenever Life reaches 0, your character dies.

    
    Depending on your race and class, you will have a certain point-base already calculated by the game.
    You will shortly be able to increase your skills by rolling a 6-face die.
